# Evaluation-of-NequIP-predicted-forces-compared-to-DFT-referenced-forces
When training a Nequip potencial with our DFT data we would probably want to take a double look to the predicted forces against the DFT forces one by one because the error given by the framework its not just general but also quite uncertain, also this would help us which partition of the training dataset needs reinforcement
